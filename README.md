# My Website (WIP)

Right now it only contains a WIP revamp of my react-sokoban game, which uses AWS services for the backend. It experiments with mobx for state management and some interesting component patterns such as for declaring keymaps, allowing keyboard arrow navigation of flex wrap elements, and integrating Recaptcha. You can play with it `yarn add` and `yarn run cosmos` to run the development playground.  The AWS code is in the `aws` folder for reference. 

The game will be published to my site soon!
